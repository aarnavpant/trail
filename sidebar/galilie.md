# SAP Galilie framework

## Overview 
Galilei is the code-name of a HTML5/JavaScript based reusable framework for developing diagram editors for the Web and Cloud. It can be used with SAP UI5 or with other UI frameworks.

The project was started early 2013 to develop a Web-based PowerDesigner. PowerDesigner is an enterprise modeling tool that supports almost 50 diagrams for Business Process Model, Data Model, UML Model, Enterprise Architecture Model, etc. Therefore, we need a good models and diagrams development library that could help us to re-develop all the existing diagrams for the Web quickly.

## Goals
* The goals of Galilei is providing a reusable, model-driven, diagram editor framework that would provide all the common diagramming services.
* It can be used by PowerDesigner team and could be reused also by other products.
* We would inner-source or include it in SAP UI5 when it will be more complete.
