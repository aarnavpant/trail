### What is InnerSource?
Successful Open Source projects established communities which - on the one hand - consist of many different contributing individuals and companies distributed around the globe, and - on the other hand - work in a very efficient and productive way.

InnerSource is the application of methodologies and best practices from these communities to in-house software development, i.e. InnerSource projects are - in contrast to OpenSource projects - not public, but exist inside the walls of a company and thus can contain IP that the company doesnâ€™t want to share with the public. In practice, InnerSourced projects want to and accept contributions from developers of other departments or projects teams of the same company.

An InnerSource approach:
* increases the quality of code and documentation,
* enables cross-team and organization innovation
* and can help to overcome silo boundaries
